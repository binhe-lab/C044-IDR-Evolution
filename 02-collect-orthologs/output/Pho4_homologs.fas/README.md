This folder contains single Pho4 blastp hit .fas sequence which were retrieved from the Shen et al 2018 ( (PMID: 30415838)
The hits were obtained from an already orthomcl_out reciprocal blast file used in the genome assembly file containing the fasta sequences. 
The hits were filtered for seqeunces with a single hit and using the species_name@seq_identifier, were retrieved using the retrive_sequences.sh script 
These .fas sequence will be used for further analysis to explore the evolution of ScPho4 protein
